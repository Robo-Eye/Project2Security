# Task 1: The project allows the application to add a new user to the password store.

# Task 2: The project allows the application to remove a user from the password store.

# Task 3: The project allows the application to check a userâ€™s password.

# Task 4: The project allows the application to print the password file.

# Task 5: The application correctly saves and loads the password store to/from a file.

# Task 6: Thoroughly document your code.
